Downscaling methods explained:
(using only daily values of the field in question, and hourly historical data of same for "training")


10m Wind speed:

	For the target date, t:
	
		Take the daily max wind speed at t-2, t-1, t, t+1, t+2
		
		Fit a cubic polynomial, minimising RMSE with weights [0.1, 0.4, 1.0, 0.4, 0.1]
		- assuming each daily mean value is the value at 12h
		
		Assign the hourly wind speeds on day t from 0h - 23h according to this polynomial
		
		
		
Surface shortwave:
		
	Training:
	
		Get 37 year hourly timeseries of shortwave
	
		For each individual day (37*365 = 13505):
			calculate the mean shortwave
			divide the shortwave at every hour in this day by this mean
			
		Now every day has a daily mean of one
		
		For each calendar day (365):
			take the mean diurnal cycle over all (37) instances of this calendar day in training period
			
	Downscaling:
	
		For the target date:
		
			Take the mean dirnal cycle for the calendar day of the target date
			
			Multiply by the known daily mean
			
			
			
			
2m Temperature (basic):

	Training:
	
		Get 37 year hourly timeseries of shortwave
	
		For each individual day (37*365 = 13505):
			calculate the mean temperature, and the range (Tmax - Tmin)
			subtract from the temperature at every hour in this day the mean (for this day), and then divide by the range (for this day)
			
		Now every day has a daily mean of zero, and a range of one
		
		For each calendar day (365):
			take the mean diurnal cycle over all (37) instances of this calendar day in training period
			
			It should improve the method to here re-normalise, to ensure these means have range one (otherwise the range will be less than one), 
			but it makes RMSE slightly worse, so I don't do it
			
		
	Downscaling:
	
		For the target date:
		
			Take the mean dirnal cycle for the calendar day of the target date
			
			Multiply by the known daily range (Tmax - Tmin), and add the daily mean
			
			
			
			
Extension of 2m Temperature method:

	Inter-daily consistency:
	
		To further improve the accuracy of the downscaled timeseries, use information of temperature the day before and after.
		
			If the temperature at 00UTC on day t, T(t, 00UTC) is colder than the daily minimum of day t-1, Tmin(t-1):
			
				rescale the temperature on day t between 00UTC and the time of daily maximum h(Tmax(t)), such that T(t, 00UTC) = Tmin(t-1)
				
			Similarly for if T(t, 23UTC) < Tmin(t+1)
		
		Additionally:
		
			If T(t, 00UTC) - T(t-1, 23UTC) > 1.5 * {typical temperature change for one hour}:
			
				rescale the temperature on day t between 00UTC and the time of daily minimum before the time of daily maximum {h(Tmin(t)) < h(Tmax(t))}
				
		And finally, rescale the entire diurnal cycle: new guess = current guess * (known daily mean / daily mean of current guess)
		
		To ensure that mean absolute error is zero by definition, as we have the information.
