Energy hackathon.



All methods:

    Instead of predicting diurnal cycle directly, why not remove the daily mean value from that day, and for temperature and irradiance, remove either the {mean [diurnal cycle minus daily mean]} or the {mean [(diurnal cycle minus daily mean) scaled by the daily range (max-min)]}, and predict the hourly variation from this? As we have that information.

    Use mean solar to do same for net surface short wave: calculate mean diurnal cycle for calendar day, with daily mean 1, and multiply by daily mean
    
    Wind will be harder, and more dependant on weather patterns probably.



Analogue method:

- use pressure pca clustering on TEST DATA (gridded ERA5, daily mean) to define a number of weather patterns (for winter, first)
- for a given date "d" NOT in TEST DATA:
  - identify cluster that this date sits in
  - for all dates in the TEST DATA in this cluster
    - choose the N dates which best match "d", based on the minimisation of some weighted cost function of the best correlated daily variables (sum(p**2 * RMS**2) ? for p = mean pearson correlation coeff between daily variable and target variable over set of 24 hours)
  - use this set of N dates as an "analogue ensemble" to provide a distribution of probable diurnal cycles for given day based on daily mean
Note: use of clusters adds an element of nonlinearity: if we do correlations *within* each cluster, to weight analogue choices

Markov chains:

  Predictor/output:
  
    Time of daily max, tmax(d)
    
    In chains going forwards (backwards) from tmax, the temperature difference between tmax+1 (tmax-1) and tmax
    
  Inputs:
  
     The daily variables listed above, both for today, d, and tomorrow d+1 (yesterday d-1)
     Hour of day
